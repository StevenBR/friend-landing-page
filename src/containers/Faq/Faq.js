				<h4>How do I get started?</h4>

				<p><span>It's completely free to chat with our chatbot services. When you have a more challenging question, we will reach out to our community of experts for your specific area of interest. &nbsp;</span></p>
				<p><span>If you are looking for expert, 1:1 help, there is a small fee for the expert&rsquo;s time. We&rsquo;ll let you know the total price so you can confirm it before you are billed. There are no hidden fees. The first time you message a Square One Labs service, we'll ask for your credit card info, your address, etc. After that, we know who you are and everything is on autopilot from there. </span></p>

We&rsquo;ll manage the progress of your project from start to finish and will not release the money until you&rsquo;re satisfied and approve the final work.</span></p>
				<h4>Is Square One An Incubator? </h4>
				<p><span>Nope. We are not a fund and do not invest in startups for company equity. We love founders and support the entrepreneur community, however we do not accept founder applications. That said, we are always interested in connecting with talented folks across fields in design, product and engineering. Feel free to reach out at </span><a href="mailto:hello@squareonelabs.io"><span>hello@squareonelabs.io</span></a><span> or send us a text. </span></p>
				<h4>Is Square One a design firm? </h4>
				<p><span>Kind of, but not really. We like to think of ourselves as conversational designers. We were built on the idea that the current app model is broken and that the future of conversational commerce is through messaging. We love design but are focused on delivering efficient technology services and transactions via mobile messaging. </span></p>
				<h4>Why Messaging? </h4>
				<p><span>We believe customers should be able to connect to businesses and services on the messaging channels they prefer, not the other way around. &nbsp;We welcome transparency and in suggestions based on your needs. We want to help you connect the dots and get access to the right experts and services. No more app downloading, no service posting, waiting in line or price guessing. It&rsquo;s like having access to a personal assistant with an endless supply of on-demand services, minus the massive overhead that would cost you an arm and a leg.</span></p>
				<h4>How does Square One Labs make money? </h4>
